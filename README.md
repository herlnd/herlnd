# Hi, I'm H! 🗿👋

## About me

I am an industrial engineer taking my first steps to become a software developer, specifically in the web development industry.

I worked as a resource manager in different areas such as research, the manufacturing industry, the public sector, and non-profit organizations. I’ve also created and led initiatives that aim to pursue a significant change in the status quo of my home city. I’m always looking for the efficiency of the processes and adding value along the way.

## TL;DR

- 📚 I’m starting my journey to become a web developer.
- 🛠️ I’m interested in finance, video games, digital art and 3D printing.
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on web development projects linked to personal finance or video games.
